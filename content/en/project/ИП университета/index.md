In general, this whole site is a project for my university, or rather for the course Architecture of computers and operating systems.

With this project, we will slowly learn how to make websites on Hugo.

The project is divided into 6 stages, each with its own tasks. In the beginning, we just created a website and launched it using hosting on GitHub. And now we are adding information about ourselves and our projects.

All the steps are intuitive, so it doesn't cause any problems.

I will not write much here, because at the moment I do not know all the subtleties of setting up this site, maybe sometime in the future I will correct this page.
