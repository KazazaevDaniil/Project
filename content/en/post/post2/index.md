# Markdown

Markdown is a markup language for text documents. It allows you to create texts without using text editors. Markdown markup texts can be read and reproduced in any system or browser.

Markdown was created by John Gruber and Aaron Schwartz in 2004. Their goal was to create a simple and user-friendly markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed form. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without bringing it to a "beautiful" appearance. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity at the present time. Its many platforms are blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS and even messengers.

# How to use Markdown

To write something in the Markdown language, you can use any text editor, but you need to use a special markup system. This markup allows you to show where the title will be, where the text will be bold or italicized, and where a list or sub-item is needed. Markdown is somewhat similar to HTML, but it is much simpler and more readable. And the purchasers are in the editor initially or downloaded separately, but it is not difficult.

# Who uses Markdown


* Internet users who communicate in messengers and write notes in services that support markup.
* Developers who use markdown to write documentation for projects — they need a simple and reliable tool.
* Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. Markup can also be used on web pages.
* Bloggers who write longreads when they design materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion.
* Writers and copywriters who need a simple text formatting tool — markup that can be read from any device.
* Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or make flashcards to remember.

# What is it for?

* Writing documentation for the code.
* Quickly format the article to be translated into PDF or just to make it look beautiful without too much effort.
* Writing beautiful messages in messengers.
* Layout of a text document for posting on the site, but without using HTML.
* Making notes in a personal digital notebook.

# Some basic markup rules

**Main text**

For the main text, the rules are quite simple. The characters are placed either in front of the text or covers the text on both sides.

**A few examples**

\# Heading 1

\## Heading 2

\### Heading 3

This can be continued up to the 6th level of the title.

Markdown also welcomes basic text formatting

 \*Italics\* or \_cursive\_ ---> *Italics* or _cursive_

\**Bold text\** or \__bold text\__ ---> **Bold text** or __bold text__

\*\*\*Bold italics\*\*\* or \_\_\_ Bold italics\_\_\_ ---> *** Bold italics*** or ___Bold italics___

\> Quote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)
> Quote (an angle bracket is placed before each line of the quote)

— Bulleted list item

1. The first item of the numbered list (Done as usual)

2. The second item of the numbered list (and so on)

You can also make lists

\* Element of the first level

\+ Second-level element

\ is a third-level element

* First level element
+ Second level element
		- A third-level element

You can also write code in Markdown if you close it in \``\``

```
#include "iostream"

int main(){
std :: cout << "Hello reader!" << endl;
}
```

# How do I get started with Markdown

It's quite simple :) All you need to do is download or open a text editor that supports our markup
