## How was my week?

Hello again! The second week has come to an end. A few things have happened. I went to the cinema for a couple of movies, it's a fairy tale in general, you need to get out more often. It can be hard at university, but I seem to be holding on, sometimes even something turns out, it's quite possible to be happy about it.

Have you seen the new post? Markdown is a super useful thing, I advise you to get acquainted. All my posts are written on it, so far I'm not complaining, I'm even happy with how it looks.
