## Как прошла моя неделя

Hi again, the week has recently started but it is already quite eventful, both good and not so good. 

On this Monday, Carnival began and on the same day I had a birthday🤯🤯🤯, which I had not yet had time to celebrate, since I was rotting in the number of tasks that were assigned at the university.

The next day, that is, Tuesday, I got sick😁😁😁. An incredibly pleasant experience. I hope I get better after all, because this can't go on forever.
