## The fifth week..

Greetings for the fifth time!

There wasn't much going on. The second semester is almost over and exams are coming up, the schedule of which leaves much to be desired. I am gradually preparing for them, but I still need to close the rest of the subjects. The weather has returned to normal - you're drying up outside again, because it's stable at 20-25 degrees, which I don't really like.
