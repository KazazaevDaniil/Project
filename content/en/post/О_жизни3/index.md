## Как прошла моя неделя

Greetings! It's already the third week, it's incredible. This week I redid this whole site because some file decided to break and everything sank into oblivion, but now everything is fine, because you are reading this. And so, I passed several tests, as for me, quite successfully. The session will begin soon - the most difficult period. It's time to start preparing.

Yes, there was also a post about how to properly make reports on GOST.
