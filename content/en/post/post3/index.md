By compiling a practice report, the student evaluates the results of the work and draws conclusions about his qualifications, knowledge and skills acquired at the university. For a job to be accepted, it must be not only competent and meaningful.

Usually, the requirements for the design of the report are prescribed in the manuals. If there are none left at the department or in the library, refer to the regulatory documents. 

# Structure

 The report can contain up to 35-40 pages. In some cases, it is allowed to increase the volume to 45 pages. At the same time, two or three pages are allocated for the introduction. The work can have up to four sections.

According to GOST standards, the practice report should have the following structure:

	— the title page;
	— internship plan;
	— feedback from the head;
	— abstract;
	— section with abbreviations and symbols;
	— Table of contents and introduction;
	— the main part of the practical work;
	— conclusion;
	— used literature list;
	— applications and additional materials.

Applications are included in the practice as needed. 

# Requirements for the design of the work

 The design of the work according to GOST implies not only a strict structure, but also the choice of certain fonts and their sizes, proper design of the list of references and the correct placement of graphic elements in the text.

The text part of the practical work is performed in three main ways:

	— on a computer according to GOST 2.004;
	— on a typewriter;
	— by hand – according to GOST 2.304 (we are talking about using a drawing font).

If the report is typed on a computer and printed on a printer, then you should work in Word or a similar editor. Print the report on A4 sheets. The text is typed in Times New Roman font. The headings of the sections have a font size of 16 points, the headings of the subsections have 14 points. The main text is executed in a regular font with a size of 14 points. The font in sections and subsections is bold. When making a design, you need to select a single line spacing.

# Sections/subsections of the report

The practice report is divided into sections and subsections. If necessary, the work includes items and lists. Sections almost always start with a new sheet. They are numbered in Arabic numerals in order of priority. The name of the section is centered, and bold Times New Roman (16 shingles) is used for it.

The subsections are numbered in Arabic numerals. Uppercase letters are used for the names of sections, lowercase letters are used for subsections (with the exception of the first one). The latter are aligned to the left using the red line. Bold font (14 shingles) is used for subsections.

It is desirable that the names of the sections be as brief as possible – you cannot transfer words. The same applies to subsections. The distance between the title of the section and the heading of the subsection should be 8 mm. 

# Page design. Margins and margins

As mentioned earlier, the practice report is drawn up on A4 sheets. This requirement applies to all sheets in the work, including the title page. There should be no frame or similar elements on the sheets. There are enough margins: on the left – 30 mm, on the right – 10 mm, on top – 15 mm, on the bottom – 20 mm.

The pages are numbered, the countdown starts from the title page. The number is not affixed to the title. 

# Graphics, tables and other elements

The practice report may contain graphical elements, tables, and formulas.. According to GOST, images, tables and diagrams can be placed:

	— immediately after the paragraph in which the element is mentioned;
	— on the next page;
	— in the application.

The first method is most convenient: the person who starts reading the report will definitely not lose important data. He will immediately get acquainted with all the graphic elements.

Formulas are placed immediately after the mention. They are aligned in the center.

You can create a formula using the Equation Editor, and then paste it into the text of the work. Usually 14 shingles are used for the characters in the formula. 

# Requirements for the form of presentation of the report text

Individual characters cannot be used in the practice report:

	— diameter icon (the word "diameter" is written instead);
	— the symbol "-" to indicate a negative temperature (instead write the word "minus");
	— indexes of standards without a registration number;
	— mathematical symbols <, > and = without numbers.

The practice report may have its own system of names or abbreviations, but only if there is an appropriate section. It should be placed in front of the table of contents.

Working on a practice report may seem hard and tedious, but it's not as difficult as it seems. A text editor will make the task easier.
