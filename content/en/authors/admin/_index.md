Daniil Kazazaev is a first-year student at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia. I am studying at the Faculty of Physics, Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and I am slowly learning about the world of technology, because I want to connect my future with this. I would also like to eat shrimps.
